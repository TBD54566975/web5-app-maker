# Experience web5 with just the web

OMG web5. Powered by ChatGPT. 

## Pre made examples: 

Try it out in the codesandbox: 

* [Todo App](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/TBD54566975/web5-omg/tree/main/generated-examples/todo)
* [Seasons App](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/TBD54566975/web5-omg/tree/main/generated-examples/seasons)


## Development of custom examples

to run:

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY={your key here}
npm install
node index.js
```

open localhost:3000.

## How it works

There is a seed_app.html which contains a starting seed for a web5 app. 
This is then modified iteratively by ChatGPT into the app you want.
